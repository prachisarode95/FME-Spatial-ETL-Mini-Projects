This is a hands-on ETL automation repository built while completing official FME training by [Safe Software](https://www.safe.com/). It is designed to highlight my growing expertise in **FME Form (formerly Desktop)** and **FME Flow (formerly Server)**, especially for **Spatial Data Automation Roles**.

## Training-Based Project Tracks

Each folder documents exercises and mini-projects built from real Safe Academy training paths, customized to simulate real-world GIS workflows.

| Folder | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| [`FME_Form_Basic`](./FME_Form_Basic/) | Mini-projects from FME Form Basic Course (20 hours) | Completed |
| `FME_Form_Advanced` | In-progress workflows using advanced parameterization, schema mapping, dynamic fanouts, and writers (~30 hours) | In Progress |
| `FME_Flow_Authoring` | To-be-added: automation and publishing projects using FME Flow (20 hours) | Planned |

## Purpose

I'm transitioning into **ETL/Data Automation roles** where FME is a core tool. This repository reflects my structured effort to:
- Gain official FME certifications
- Translate learning into reusable mini-projects
- Build confidence and credibility for **Spatial Data Engineering Opportunities**
