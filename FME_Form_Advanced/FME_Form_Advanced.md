# FME Form Advanced – End-to-End Project-Based Learning Journey

Welcome to my hands-on journey through the [FME Form Advanced](https://academy.safe.com/path/fme-form-advanced) training by Safe Software. This course builds on core FME skills and introduces advanced techniques like workspace parameterization, schema evolution, modular design, and dynamic data handling. 

This repository contains structured, real-world-inspired projects developed from course modules to demonstrate my practical expertise with FME Form at an intermediate to advanced level.

## Learning Goals

- Build modular, maintainable FME workspaces
- Automate workflows using parameters and fanouts
- Design for schema flexibility and data variability
- Optimize performance and handle schema changes dynamically

└── Day_Two/
├── Define_Schema_Dynamically_from_External_Source/
└── Construct_Schema_with_SchemaScanner/
```
---

### Topics Covered in Part 2
- Using the generic mode for flexible format handling
- Schema mapping from incoming or external data
- Automating schema construction with `SchemaScanner`
- Designing format-agnostic workspaces

---

## Tools & Transformers Used

- FME Form (Advanced Workbench features)
- Parameters: Published, Private, User Parameters
- Core Transformers: `SchemaMapper`, `Logger`, `Tester`, `GenericReader`, `GenericWriter`, `CustomTransformer`, `AttributeExploder`, `SchemaScanner`
- Formats: CSV, GeoPackage, SHP, JSON, Excel, ZIP, WFS

---

## Repository Navigation

Each module/project includes:
- A dedicated folder
- `.fmw` workspace
- `README.md` with goals, tools, transformers used, and screenshots

---

## Status - **In Progress**  
I am actively learning the course modules and building projects as part of my GIS Data Automation portfolio.
